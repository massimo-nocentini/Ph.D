# Recurrences unfolding

This project aims to implement a prototype to unfold recurrence
relations *symbolically*. Our definitions are built on top of *SymPy*
and target Python **3.5.1**.

We describe prototype features in a [notebook][recurrences-unfolding], 
where some unfolded recurrences are shown. We split the content 
about the underlying *Binomial transform*, which arises
in the characterization of Fibonacci numbers with odd subscripts, 
in a [companion document][companion].


## A basic introduction to SymPy

Moreover, we provide a Jupyter notebook to support a lecture within the course
*Progettazione e Analisi degli Algoritmi* (PAA for short) taught
by professors [Merlini] and [Verri] at the University of Florence. The [notebook][here]
present a basic introduction to [SymPy] for students.
