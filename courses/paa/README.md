# An introduction to SymPy

This folder holds material to support a lecture within the course
*Progettazione e Analisi degli Algoritmi* (PAA for short) taught
by professors [Donatella] and [Cecilia] at the University of Florence.

In this lecture we'll see an introduction to [SymPy], using Jupyter Notebooks
and looking under the hood at source codes ;)

The notebook can be seen [here].

Moreover, we have implemented some functions to unfold recurrences
depending on a *single* variable. The notebook with some unfolded
recurrences can be seen [here][recurrences-unfolding], with a [companion
document][companion] about the underlying *Binomial transform* arising
in the characterization of Fibonacci numbers with odd subscripts.
