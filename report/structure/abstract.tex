    \noindent In this document we show an implementation of a prototype 
    using the \emph{Python} language, on top of \emph{SymPy} module.
    It allows us to \emph{unfold} recurrence relations, where there
    is \emph{one} free variable. We show some applications to recurrences
    describing average numbers of Quicksort's checks and swaps; moreover, 
    possibly new characterizations for Fibonacci numbers are given.
